# Lab 7 Techniques 
Ovwerview:
For this lab we also were using github and utilizing multiple skills learned from previous labs and projects in order to be utilized after we had officially created a github account to house work.

Goal: 
To be able to use Git Repo, commit files and have them work correctly to be recalled at any time for use in the project and validation.
